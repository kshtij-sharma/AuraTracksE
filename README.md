Music Recommendation System
This project involves creating a music recommendation system that suggests songs based on the user's current emotional state. Built with Python, it uses facial expression recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to detect emotions. For facial recognition, a pre-trained deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), analyzes webcam-captured images to classify emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.). Additionally, NLP techniques can be used to analyze text inputs for emotion detection.
Based on the identified emotion, the system recommends a playlist or specific tracks that match the mood, using a pre-curated database of songs categorized by mood. Libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn are utilized for emotion detection, while Python's music-related libraries (such as Pygame or Spotipy) are employed to manage the song playback.
This project enhances user experience by providing personalized music suggestions that resonate with the userâ€™s feelings, making it a unique blend of machine learning, computer vision, and music recommendation technologies.
